		waking could suffer from temporary amnesia, dizziness, double vision,
		or impaired speech.  The GM could apply a -1 to -3 penalty on the
		character's CV, Perception, and Skill Rolls to reflect this.  This 
		may also leave an NPC dead or dying, at the GM's discretion.

		hand.  He suffers a -3 OCV for any attacks using that arm, and -3

		with that arm causes the character to take 2d6 STUN, no defense.
